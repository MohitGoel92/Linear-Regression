# Supervised Learning: Linear Regression

There are different types of machines learning, they include:
- Supervised: When the data points have a known outcome.
- Unsupervised: When the data points have an unknown outcome.
- Semi-Supervised: When we have data with known outcomes and data without outcomes.

The equation below represents a machine learning function:

where
  - X: Inpute
  - Y_p: Output (values predicted by the model)
  - f(.): Prediction function that generates predictions from x and omega
  
**Observations:** The rows or examples/samples the model will see.
**Features:** The different ways that we measure each observation (variables that may or may not influence the target variable).

- A single observation can be represented by a row.
